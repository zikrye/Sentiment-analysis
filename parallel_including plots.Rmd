# Word clouds for the whole book

1. Wordcloud below shows 100 most common used words in _THE RED AND THE BLACK_. The size of the words in the wordcloud represents the frequency of the words shown in the book. Apparently, the hero name julien appears the most. "de" means "of" in English. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
tidy_randb %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  count(word) %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 100))
```

2. Wordcloud below shows most commonly used words that are positive or negative in the book. For example, 'death' and 'poor' are often used in describing the plots. 'great', 'like' and 'love' are frequently used and it makes sense because the book involves the love story of julien.  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
tidy_randb %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
  comparison.cloud(colors = c("gray80", "gray20"),
                   max.words = 100)

# Sentiment analysis of words

- There are three main lexicon used when doing sentiment analysis for words. Here follow their results and another lexicon called loughran is also analyzed. 
```{r include=FALSE}
# sentiment information references
afinn <- get_sentiments("afinn")
bing <- get_sentiments("bing")

## Lexicon NRC

- There are 10 types of sentiment levels in NRC: trust, surprise, positive, joy, anticipation, fear, negative, sadness, anger, disgust. 
- The graphs below represent: 
    1. The number of words in each level of sentiment
    2. 10 mostly used words in each level of sentiment
    3. Wordcloud of 100 mostly used words in the 'joy' sentiment level
    4. Sentiment value based on index of 100 (100 promises senitment can be analyzed within the chapter)

## Lexicon LOUGHRAN

- There are 6 types of sentiment levels in LOUGHRAN: negative, positive, uncertainty, litigious, constraining, superfluous 
- The graphs below represent: 
    1. The number of words in each level of sentiment
    2. 10 mostly used words in each level of sentiment
    3. Wordclouds of 100 mostly used words in positive
    4. The frequency change of each sentiment level based on chapters
    5. Sentiment value based on index of 100 (100 promises sentiment can be analyzed within the chapter)
- We can notice that the levels of sentiment in LOUGHRAN are mostly negative words, and we can also understand from plot 5 that the values of sentiment are mostly below the zero line.

## Compare lexicons

- Graphs below shows the comparison of sentiment for four lexicon methods. 
- The NRC sentiment is high, the AFINN sentiment has more variance, the Bing et al. sentiment has longer stretches of similar text, but all three agree roughly on the overall trends in the sentiment through a narrative arc. However, sentiment of LOUGHRAN are mostly below the zero line which can be explained by that most sentiment level in lexicon LOUGHRAN are negative classifications. As we can seen from the graphs of numbers of words in each sentiment level above. 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bing_nrc_loug <- bind_rows(
  tidy_randb %>% 
    inner_join(bing, by = "word") %>%
    mutate(method = "Bing et al."),
  
  tidy_randb %>% 
    inner_join(nrc %>% 
                 filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", 
                                         "negative")), by = "word"
    ) %>%
    mutate(method = "NRC"), 
  
  tidy_randb %>% 
    inner_join(loug %>% 
                 filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", 
                                         "negative")), by = "word"
    ) %>%
    mutate(method = "LOUGHRAN")
  ) %>%
  count(method, index = linenumber %/% 100, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment,
              values_from = n,
              values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)


bind_rows(randb_afinn_senti, 
          bing_nrc_loug) %>%

```
- Although the book ends with Julien death, the whole book mainly talks about how he pursed his occupation and love. And Stendhal shows how Julien lost his reputation and got sentenced in the last several paragraphs, which is the main part that most negative words should be used. Given the above reasons, I think using lexicon BING is more proper for this book because there are a concentrated negative value of sentiment in the BING graph and the value of sentiment presents evenly in the previous chapters.

- The following graphs shows the comparison of sentiment of four kinds of lexicon between the one done before and the one done using TNUM. 
- After TNUM, the trends of sentiment looks similar to the original one under the lexicon NRC. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# library("egg")
grid.arrange(p_nrc+ ylim(-30, 60), 
             p_nrc_tnum+ ylim(-30, 60), nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
```

- After TNUM, the trends of sentiment also looks similar to the original one under the lexicon AFINN. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grid.arrange(p_afinn+ ylim(-50, 100)
             , p_afinn_tnum+ ylim(-50, 100), nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
```

- After TNUM, the absolute value of sentiment changes little compared to the original one under the lexicon BING. Higher value of sentiment of index can also be noticed. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grid.arrange(p_bing+ ylim(-45, 75), 
             p_bing_tnum+ ylim(-45, 75), nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
```

- After TNUM, the trends of sentiment also looks similar to the original one under the lexicon LOUGHRAN.  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grid.arrange(p_loug+ ylim(-25, 15), 
             p_loug_tnum+ ylim(-25, 15), nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
```




# Create tags

- Since _THE RED AND THE BLACK_ includes two love stories: Julien and Madame de Rênal, Julien and Mathilde de la Mole, tag 'love' is created. From the above analysis, word love appears in the book for 278 times. 
- Plot of numbers of 'love' in each paragraph shows the love story goes through the whole book. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

  subject <- df$subject
    for(i in 1 : n) {
      vector[i] <- as.numeric(substring(str_split(subject[i], "[:/]")[[1]][3], 1))
    }
  return(vector)
}

- Here follows plots of number of words in each chapter for three main character: Julien, Renal and Mole. 
- An interesting point can be noticed that Renal mostly presents in the first half of all the chapters and it makes sense because Julien first fell in love with Renal. Similarly, Mole presents in the second half of the whole chapters and it is because then Julien met Mole.
